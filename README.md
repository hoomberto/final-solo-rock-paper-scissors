## Introduction
This is an interactive website that is meant to demonstrate an understanding of JS Class interaction, rendering from the data model, event delegation, and problem solving. This site allows users to play a classic game of rock, paper, scissors, or a more difficult variant called Battle of the Zodiac, which plays similarly to an RPG fighting game.

Users will have an initial evaluation made between the comparison of the selected sign's element and quality

A battle between the two signs ensues - if the user wins, a new challenger from the Zodiac will appear until the zodiac is empty, otherwise if the user loses, a new game will start. Try to conquer the Zodiac!
